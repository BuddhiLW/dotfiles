# Filesystem MCP Server

Node.js server implementing Model Context Protocol (MCP) for filesystem operations.

## Features

- Read/write files
- Create/list/delete directories
- Move files/directories
- Search files
- Get file metadata

**Note**: The server will only allow operations within directories specified via `args`.

## API

### Resources

- `file://system`: File system operations interface

### Tools

- **read_file**
  - Read complete contents of a file
  - Input: `path` (string)
  - Reads complete file contents with UTF-8 encoding

- **read_multiple_files**
  - Read multiple files simultaneously
  - Input: `paths` (string[])
  - Failed reads won't stop the entire operation

- **write_file**
  - Create new file or overwrite existing (exercise caution with this)
  - Inputs:
    - `path` (string): File location
    - `content` (string): File content

- **edit_file**
  - Make selective edits using advanced pattern matching and formatting
  - Features:
    - Line-based and multi-line content matching
    - Whitespace normalization with indentation preservation
    - Fuzzy matching with confidence scoring
    - Multiple simultaneous edits with correct positioning
    - Indentation style detection and preservation
    - Git-style diff output with context
    - Preview changes with dry run mode
    - Failed match debugging with confidence scores
  - Inputs:
    - `path` (string): File to edit
    - `edits` (array): List of edit operations
      - `oldText` (string): Text to search for (can be substring)
      - `newText` (string): Text to replace with
    - `dryRun` (boolean): Preview changes without applying (default: false)
    - `options` (object): Optional formatting settings
      - `preserveIndentation` (boolean): Keep existing indentation (default: true)
      - `normalizeWhitespace` (boolean): Normalize spaces while preserving structure (default: true)
      - `partialMatch` (boolean): Enable fuzzy matching (default: true)
  - Returns detailed diff and match information for dry runs, otherwise applies changes
  - Best Practice: Always use dryRun first to preview changes before applying them

- **create_directory**
  - Create new directory or ensure it exists
  - Input: `path` (string)
  - Creates parent directories if needed
  - Succeeds silently if directory exists

- **list_directory**
  - List directory contents with [FILE] or [DIR] prefixes
  - Input: `path` (string)

- **move_file**
  - Move or rename files and directories
  - Inputs:
    - `source` (string)
    - `destination` (string)
  - Fails if destination exists

- **search_files**
  - Recursively search for files/directories
  - Inputs:
    - `path` (string): Starting directory
    - `pattern` (string): Search pattern
    - `excludePatterns` (string[]): Exclude any patterns. Glob formats are supported.
  - Case-insensitive matching
  - Returns full paths to matches

- **get_file_info**
  - Get detailed file/directory metadata
  - Input: `path` (string)
  - Returns:
    - Size
    - Creation time
    - Modified time
    - Access time
    - Type (file/directory)
    - Permissions

- **list_allowed_directories**
  - List all directories the server is allowed to access
  - No input required
  - Returns:
    - Directories that this server can read/write from

## Usage with Claude Desktop
Add this to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

Note: you can provide sandboxed directories to the server by mounting them to `/projects`. Adding the `ro` flag will make the directory readonly by the server.

### Docker
Note: all directories must be mounted to `/projects` by default.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "--mount", "type=bind,src=/Users/username/Desktop,dst=/projects/Desktop",
        "--mount", "type=bind,src=/path/to/other/allowed/dir,dst=/projects/other/allowed/dir,ro",
        "--mount", "type=bind,src=/path/to/file.txt,dst=/projects/path/to/file.txt",
        "mcp/filesystem",
        "/projects",
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### NPX

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
        "/Users/username/Desktop",
        "/path/to/other/allowed/dir"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Build
