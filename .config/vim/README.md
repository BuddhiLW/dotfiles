# Vi-ish Vim Configuration

Learning anything but pure `vi` first will become a liability when you
want to be productive on a remote computer that doesn't have your
precious configurations. If you are never using another computer for
anything you might want to look at `emacs` instead, but you still have
to learn `vi` if you want to learn an editor that actually follows the
[UNIX philosophy](https://duck.com/lite?kd=-1&kp=-1&q=UNIX philosophy) (`emacs` sure the fuck doesn't). By the way, don't
abandon `vi` until you have at least learned the
[magic](https://rwx.gg/vimagic) that makes `vi` objectively superior to
every other editor on the planet. Most who leave or criticize it never
even learn the most powerful aspect of it: full shell integration.

## Why not use Vim 8 native plugins?

Because they suck. They require everything be the `.vim/pack` directory
and there is no mechanism for pulling down the plugins from git hosting.
