# Snippets and Templates Library

Code templates and other snippets that I often find myself needing to
source or paste. I use them with a `snip` script. Your mileage may vary.

## Conventions

* Directories named after Vim file types
* Files have no suffixes
* Use full shebang for syntax even if deleted
* Executable just for convenience (don't add to `PATH`)
* Initial paragraph of explanatory comment (easy to delete)
* Always use `shellcheck` before saving
