# Scripts

Pilfer at your own peril. You'll find mostly just bash and perl. If
that's not your thing, don’t waste your time — especially if you use
`zsh-it` for anything. If you have questions, come ask me on
<https://rwxrob.tv>.

More substantial commands have their own repos prefixed with [`cmd-`]
derived [`template-bash-command`]. Other commands (like the popular
[`pomo`] tool) are compiled go utilities with repos prefixed with
[`cmdbox-`].

[`template-bash-command`]: <https://github.com/rwxrob/template-bash-command>

## Installation

Best way to use these is to grab them and put them into your own stuff.
If the shebang lines don't work it means you are using a shitty operating
system (not my problem, fuck off) or you want to use them on something
besides Linux (again, fuck off). If you are one of the very few wanting
to put something on Alpine (the god of all container OS distros) then
you probably won't even read this and already will have fixed the other
stuff to your liking.
